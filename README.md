# gradle-openapi-custom-codegen
An example of creating and using a custom code generator for Spring

# Motivation
Some custom generators do not provide the required power so that you do not have to make changes manually. The example shows how you can change the name of the main() class that SpringCodegen creates from OpenAPIGenerator to something you choose.

# Steps
1. Open lib and run publishToMavenLocal first
2. run OpenApiGenerate to build files
